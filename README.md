# R 4.5.1 - Batteries Included

R Batteries Included detects your CPU cores and configures itself for maximum performance. I created this to assist some lab colleagues who were struggling with the R setup on their Windows machines.

The installer includes OpenBLAS for faster linear algebra operations and the components required to install packages from source (e.g., from GitHub).

Your existing code works exactly the same, just faster, and does not requires changes to existing workflows.

Whether you're analyzing large datasets, running simulations, or building statistical models, this is the easiest performance upgrade you'll ever make.
